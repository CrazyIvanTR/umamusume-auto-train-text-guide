# Bluestacks Guide
This is an extention to the readme, for a beginner guide on how to make the bot work, you should read the readme file here.

Install [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) (I was using version 5.22, should be compatible with any higher version)

# Device Setup
After installation, start Bluestacks, click the gear icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+I) on the side bar <img width="29" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7c9559-fe0e-455c-a7a7-76153db5ac2b" />

Go to display, under display resolution select custom, add resolution 800x1080 and set the pixel density to 160 DPI.

Save changes and restart.

After this, click the multi instance manager icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+8) on the side bar <img width="33" height="39" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/655d746d-c83e-43d8-bb44-7d6f57825700" />

In the screen that opens, hover over the name of the instance and click the edit button:

Name the instance "Bluestacks Umamusume", without the quotes of course. The name has to be exact or the code won't work properly.

After you're done with the installation, the bot should work as normal.

For now, the only version of the bot that works with bluestacks is [here](https://github.com/CrazyIvanTR/umamusume-auto-train/tree/bluestacks_work). I'll see about getting it added to the main repo.
